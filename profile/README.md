# Software Carpentry Internationalisation Hub
The `swcarpentry-i18n` organisation contains forks of Software Carpentry lessons set up to sync with translation/localisation efforts within [The Carpentries CrowdIn projects](https://carpentries.crowdin.com/).
The official Software Carpentry lesson repositories can be found at <https://github.com/swcarpentry/> and localised versions of lessons can be found listed below.

## List of locales
The READMEs linked below contain a list of the SWC lessons currently localised to the given language/locale, and guidance for how newcomers can get involved in these localisation efforts.
Language Coordinators are community members who have volunteered to coordinate localisation of lessons with CrowdIn, and can manage access to translation projects.

<!-- Locales listed in English alphabetical order, but headings can be localised with English version afterwards in parentheses, e.g. Deutsch (German) -->
